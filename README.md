## Getting Started

To get started with Wolfcord, you'll need to create a new Discord bot application through the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Once you have created your bot, you will obtain a token that you'll use to authenticate your bot with the Discord API.

Here's a basic example of how to create a simple Discord bot using Wolfcord:

```python
import wolfcord
from wolfcord.ext import commands

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix=prefix,intents=wolfcord.Intents.all())
# Event: on_ready
@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'We have logged in as {client.user}')

# Event: on_message
@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    if message.content.startswith('!hello'):
        await message.channel.send('Hello!')

# Run the bot with your Discord bot token
client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
```

Replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.
